# Navigator
- The JavaScript Navigator provides information about the web browser and its capabilities. You can reference the Navigator object via the read-only window.navigator property.

The Navigator object has properties that convey the browser’s information. For example, the userAgent is a property of the window.navigator object. It is a long string that identifies the web browser.
- The different web browser provides specific capabilities which are not standardized. It’s better not to use the userAgent to identify the web browser because some web browsers allow users to modify the userAgent to pretend they are using a different browser.
