#### Selecting elements

#### getElementById() â€“ select an element by id.
An HTML element often has an id attribute like this:
< div id="root"></ div>

The id is used to uniquely identify an HTML element within the document. By rules, the id root is unique within the document; no other elements can have this root id.

The id is case-sensitive. For example, the 'root' and 'Root' are totally different id.

To select the element by its id, you use the document.getElementById method.

The following shows the syntax of the getElementById() method:
let element = document.getElementById(id);

In this syntax, the id represents the id of the element that you want to select.

The getElementById() returns an Element object that describes the DOM element object with the specified id. It returns null if there is no element with that id exists.

As mentioned earlier, id is unique within a document. However, HTML is a forgiving language. If a document has more than one element with the same id, the getElementById() method returns the first one it encounters.

#### JavaScript getElementById() method example

- < html>
    < head>
        < title>JavaScript getElementById() Method</ title>
    < /head>
    < body>
        < p id="message">A paragraph< /p>
    < /body>
< /html>

- The document contains a < p> element that has the id attribute with the value message:

const p = document.getElementById('message');
console.log(p);

output: < p id="message">A paragraph< /p>

Once you selected an element, you can add styles to the element, manipulate its attributes, and traversing to parent and child elements.

#### Summary 

- The getElementById() returns a DOM element specified by an id or null if no matching element found.
- If multiple elements share the same id, even though it is invalid, the getElementById() returns the first element it encounters.
